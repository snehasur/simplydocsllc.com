                        <h3>Reduced Payment Plans</h3>
                        <p><strong>Loan Repayment Plans: </strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Standard:</strong> With the standard plan, you'll pay a fixed amount each month until your loans are paid in full. Your monthly payments will be at least $50. 
The standard plan is good for you if you can handle higher monthly payments because you'll repay your loans more quickly. Your monthly payment under the standard plan may be higher than it would be under the other plans because your loans will be repaid in the shortest time.  </p>

                        <p><strong>Graduated:</strong> With this plan your payments start out low and increase every two years. The length of your repayment period will be up to ten years. If you expect your income to increase steadily over time, this plan may be right for you. Your monthly payment will never be less than the amount of interest that accrues between payments. Although your monthly payment will gradually increase, no single payment under this plan will be more than three times greater than any other payment.   </p>

                        <p><strong>Income Contingent:</strong> This plan gives you the flexibility to meet your Direct Loan obligations without causing undue financial hardship. Each year, your monthly payments will be calculated based on your adjusted gross income (AGI, plus your spouse's income if you're married), family size, and the total amount of your Direct Loans. Under the ICR plan you will pay each month the lesser of:  </p>

                        <p><strong>Income Based:</strong> Under this plan the required monthly payment will be based on your income during any period when you have a partial financial hardship. Your monthly payment may be adjusted annually. The maximum repayment period under this plan may exceed 10 years. If you meet certain requirements over a specified period, you may qualify for cancellation of any outstanding balance of your loans.  </p>

                        <p><strong>Pay as You Earn:</strong> Under this plan the required monthly payment will be based on your income during any period when you have a partial financial hardship. Your monthly payment may be adjusted annually. The maximum repayment period under this plan may exceed 10 years. If you meet certain requirements over a specified period, you may qualify for cancellation of any outstanding balance of your loans. The difference between PAYE and IBR is: PAYE is 10% of the difference between your AGI and the poverty level for family size and state and IBR is 15% of the difference between your AGI and the poverty level for family size and state.  </p>
