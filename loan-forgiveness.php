Forgiveness the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program is probably the most beneficial of all the loan forgiveness plans available as teachers not only qualify for early forgiveness, but principal reduction as well. Teachers can be eligible for $5,000 to $17,500 in principal reduction on their loans under certain circumstances in the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program. The idea behind this principal reduction was to encourage young graduates to enter a career of teaching, and to continue that career. Teachers also qualify for complete loan forgiveness after 10 years of repaying their loans. Contact us for more information.
